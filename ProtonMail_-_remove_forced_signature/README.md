This userscript applies to https://mail.protonmail.com.  
It automatically removes the ProtonMail signature from the 'New message' textboxes,  
which is appended by default to each mail body and cannot be modified via Settings in free accounts.

It uses the excellent library [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive)
