<!--
Thanks for reporting a bug! â›°

1. Start the issue title having the related script title in parenthesis. 
2. Make sure the bug is caused by the userscript. Try disabling the other userscripts (and extensions) first.
3. Be as specific as possible, I need to know where to look. Provide STR (steps to reproduce) if needed.
4. Include a full URL where the bug appears.
5. Include a screenshot/gif so I can help you better.
6. Include name and version of your browser and script manager
(Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey are supported - Greasemonkey is not supported).  

If I can't see the issue nor can replicate it easily, I can't help.
