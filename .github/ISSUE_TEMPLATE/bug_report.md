<!--
Thanks for reporting a bug! â›°

1. Start the issue title with the related script name in parenthesis. 
2. Make sure the bug is caused by the script: try disabling the other scripts (and extensions) first.
3. Be as specific as possible, I need to know where to look. 
4. Provide STR (steps to reproduce) and a full URL where the bug appears, if needed. 
5. Include a screenshot/gif so I can help you better.
6. Include name and version of your browser and script manager (Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey are supported - Greasemonkey is not supported).  

If I can't see the issue nor can replicate it easily, I can't help.
