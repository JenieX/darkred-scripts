<!--
Thanks for reporting a bug! â›°

1. Start the issue title with the related script name in parenthesis. 
2. Make sure the bug is caused by the script: try disabling the other scripts (and extensions) first, and/or even better in a fresh browser profile.
3. When the script doesn't work, is it because it doesn't run at all in the page (check TM/VM's toolbar dropdown button), or because it has errors in Console? 
If it's the former them its `@include` rule needs additions. If it's the latter, include the Console errors in your report.
3. Provide STR (steps to reproduce) and a full URL where the bug appears, if needed. 
4. Be as specific as possible, I need to know where to look. 
5. Include a screenshot/gif in so I can help you better. 
6. Include name and version of your browser and script manager (Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey are supported - Greasemonkey is not supported). 

If I can't see the issue nor can replicate it easily, I can't help.
