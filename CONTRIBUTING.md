## How to Report Issues, Or Make Requests.

When reporting problems:
- Start the issue title having the related script title in parenthesis. 
- Be as specific as possible, I need to know where to look. 
- State name and version of your browser and script manager.
- Provide a web address example where I can see the problem for myself. A domain name is not enough.
- Provide a screenshot if necessary. 

When making feature requests:
- Be as specific as possible, don't make me have to guess what you want.
