Hides scripts for popular browser games and social networks as well as scripts that use "foreign" characters in descriptions, when browsing or searching scripts.  
i.e. it filters any/all of these 4 categories:  
* **Games**: scripts for browser games like Kingdoms of Camelot, Mafia Wars and Ikariam  
* **Social Networks**: scripts for general purpose social networking sites like Facebook, studiVZ and VKontakte  
* **Non-ASCII**: scripts that use non-English characters in description (accents, umlauts, cyrillic letters, ...)  
* **Clutter**: obvious spam, titles like "asdasdasd", description = title, title < 6 characters, "just a test", styles that offer themes/dark/night mode.  

The filters list appears just below the `#script-list-option-groups` element (i.e. on the right).

*<u>Note</u>: you may uncomment line 35 (and comment out line 46), in order the filtered scripts to be highlighted khaki -instead of hiding them- so that you can check which scripts have been filtered.*  

This is a modified version of this script: [userscripts.org Bullshit Filter](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/97145) (by kuehlschrank).  
Thanks a lot to kuehlschrank for making another great script.
