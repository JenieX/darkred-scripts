This script applies to 1337X torrent lists.
- it converts torrent timestamps to relative format in local timezone. Also, it recalculates them every 1 min. 
- The initial timestamps are still available as tooltips (on mouse hover), also converted to local timezone.

It uses [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [moment-timezone.js](http://momentjs.com/timezone/).
