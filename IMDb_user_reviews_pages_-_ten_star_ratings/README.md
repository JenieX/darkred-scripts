This userscript applies to IMDb user reviews pages. It displays the ratings with 10 stars, instead of just 1.  
_It also works when you click the 'Load More' button to view more reviews._

Note: if you use this style: [IMDb.com - Nightmode](https://userstyles.org/styles/98447/imdb-com-nightmode) (like me) then comment out line 22 and uncomment line 29,  
in order the extra stars to be almost-black (instead of almost-white).
